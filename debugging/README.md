# 🤖 ChatGPT – Introduction  
## Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with AI  

Welcome to the **ChatGPT - Introduction** project!  
This module explores how artificial intelligence, specifically **ChatGPT**, can assist developers in debugging code and automating repetitive tasks — boosting both productivity and code quality.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 🐞 Debugging
- Learn how to use ChatGPT to identify and resolve bugs in various code samples.
- Gain a deeper understanding of common programming issues across different languages.
- Improve your ability to explain problems clearly and fix them with AI support.

### ⚙️ Automation
- Automate tedious coding tasks using AI: boilerplate generation, docstrings, and basic tests.
- Focus on more creative or complex tasks by offloading repetitive parts to ChatGPT.

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

✅ **Improved Debugging Proficiency**  
Become more confident in spotting and fixing issues quickly using ChatGPT.  

✅ **Automation Skills**  
Save time by generating structured, reusable, and clean code with the help of AI tools.  

✅ **Modern Developer Toolkit**  
Prepare for industry practices where AI-assisted development is becoming standard.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

| File Name                | Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`              | Project documentation (this file).                              |
| `change_background.html` | Simple HTML for modifying background color via JS.              |
| `checkbook.py`           | Sample script potentially used for automation/debug demo.       |
| `factorial.py`           | Iterative factorial function.                                   |
| `factorial_recursive.py` | Recursive factorial function.                                   |
| `mines.py`               | Possibly a game or logic demo — used to practice debugging.     |
| `print_arguments.py`     | Demonstrates command-line arguments handling.                   |
| `tic.py`                 | Likely a tic-tac-toe (AI-influenced or classic) implementation. |

## 🧠 AI Best Practices

While ChatGPT is a powerful tool:
- **Always verify** the AI-generated code or suggestions.
- Use ChatGPT as a co-pilot, not a replacement.
- Question outputs, test thoroughly, and combine AI power with your critical thinking.

---

## 📎 Requirements

- All Python files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Files must be executable and end with a new line
- Follow **pycodestyle** (PEP8) — version `2.7.*`
- Project should contain a valid `README.md`
- File length may be tested using `wc` command
- Use **Python 3.10+** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment)

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python 3.10  
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the front-end component)  
- ChatGPT (OpenAI platform)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Ubuntu 22.04 (or compatible environment)
